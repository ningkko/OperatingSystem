## Threading

### Determinsim and Non-Determinism
- Dterminism
	-  Logical
	- Like a function
- Non-determinism
	- Randomness

### Cridical condition

Thread A:
for i in range (n):
	count+=1

Thread B:
for i in range (n):
	count-=1

- This is called a *data race*

Both threads 1. load, 2. inc/dec, 3. Store

### Mutual Exclusion
- Like Synchronized(app){} in Java and atomic (Python has this)
- Mutex in Java is developed for this

### Atomicity

### join()
- Wait for the thread object to be done.
- Can be used for progress bar...
- Java doe snot let to do this anymore
- can put a time limit: join(time)
