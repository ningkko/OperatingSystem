#### Operating system (OS) ::= 
system softwares manage computer hardware and software resources and provide common services for programs

e.g. JAVA JFame, open a window
Python, import datetime
Phone orientation

#### RAM ::= Random Access Memory
(Not random, e.g. memories in a disk)
#### ROM ::= Read-Only Memory
#### I/O ::= input/output
(opening a file, reading, outputtingâ€¦)
#### HTTP ::= Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
#### SSD ::= Solid State Disk

C is the operating language so it cares about memory overflow. Have to throw exception when creating variables 

### PROBLEMS IN OS:

- Memory is finite
- Hard drive space is finite
- CPU can only excite one thing a time: FETCH one assembly command, EXCUTE, and STORE the result. How to run separate programs?
